# Hi, I'm Usama 👋

I’m a passionate iOS Engineer with 8+ years of experience building high-impact mobile applications across startups and large-scale platforms. I specialize in **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **mobile architecture**, with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and clean design.

Currently, I’m exploring the intersection of **AI**, **SwiftUI**, and **interactive user experiences**, while working on projects like:
- 📱 [GitHub Repositories Viewer](https://github.com/usama-jamil/GithubRepoViewer-SwiftUI) – a SwiftUI project to explore public repos using GitHub APIs
- 🌦️ Weather App (WIP) – a modular SwiftUI app fetching real-time weather using public APIs
